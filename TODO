Current work:


TODO
* figure out framebuffers so i can use tty1
* why is micro too small
* raise log level to 6
* figure out objcopy cmdline
* get network working. ip works but eth0 isnt a real device

v2
* no multi-tool binaries. replace busybox with sbase or rust core utils plus shell + init. init can be busybox. i'll build it with one module only. the tiny inittab is too convenient
* shell can be dash
* https://github.com/ksdme/ut
* change kernel config. need less storage drivers since im booting in qemu
* nushell maybe. they already provide static musl binaries
