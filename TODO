Current work:
things were working great when i was setting the console to ttyS0.
i switched to tty1 after setting some framebuffer stuff to y
tty1 still does not work. i suspect its because the CONFIG_FB_EFI option
was not in defconfig. i wonder what the correct option is.

TODO
* figure out what went wrong with my kernel

v2
* no multi-tool binaries. replace busybox with sbase or rust core utils plus shell + init
* init can be busybox. i'll build it with one module only. the tiny inittab is too convenient
* shell can be dash
* https://github.com/ksdme/ut
* change kernel config. need less storage drivers since im booting in qemu
