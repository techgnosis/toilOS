Current status:
* ran into a wall running getty. doing some reorg for now

TODO
* build the image in a container. need --privileged
* change kernel config. need less storage drivers since im booting in qemu




v2
* no multi-tool binaries. replace busybox with sbase or rust core utils plus shell + init
* init can be busybox. i'll build it with one module only. the tiny inittab is too convenient
* shell can be dash
