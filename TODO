Current work:


TODO
* get network working. ip works but eth0 isnt a real device
* minimize custom.config. its pretty random atm

v2
* no multi-tool binaries. replace busybox with sbase or rust core utils plus shell + init. init can be busybox. i'll build it with one module only. the tiny inittab is too convenient
* shell can be nushell maybe. they already provide static musl binaries
